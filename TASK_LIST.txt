	1.General Tokenization:
		Split the input line into individual tokens.
		Handle special characters and operators correctly.
		Ensure proper handling of whitespace characters.

	2.Quoted Strings:
		Identify and handle quoted strings (single and double quotes).
		Interpret escape characters within quoted strings.

	3.Special Characters:
		Handle special characters like redirection symbols (>, <, >>) and pipe (|) appropriately.
		Recognize and tokenize environment variables (e.g., $HOME).

	4.Nested Structures:
		Support nested structures like parentheses and nested quoted strings.
		Ensure proper nesting and matching of opening and closing characters.

	5.Error Handling:
		Detect and report syntax errors accurately.
		Provide clear and informative error messages for better user experience.

	6.Testing:
		Thoroughly test the tokenizer with various inputs, including valid commands and syntax errors.
		Verify correct behavior under different scenarios and edge cases.

	7.Performance:
		Optimize the tokenizer for performance, especially for large inputs or complex syntax rules.
		Consider efficiency in tokenization algorithms and data structures.
